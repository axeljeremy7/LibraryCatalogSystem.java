# LibraryCatalogSystem

The program is library catalog system that read from file.
In mu case I create two items book and periodical. Both items are subclasses from Libray class with its interface.

The items of the library can be chechek out thanks to Gregorian Calendar class form java.
Also, I create a Controller class with its interface. In this class I make the code of the functionality 
of the program before it is tested.

The purposes are the use of inheritance and the practice of overriding superclass methods in sublcasses.
